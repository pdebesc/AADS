\section*{Randomized algorithms summary - Ada Nzulumike}

Introduction:
\\
- Advantages over deterministic algorithms (performance, simple to describe and implement)
\\
- Bound on performance (rely on random choiches, not on any assumptions about the input)

RandQS:
\\
- Explain the algorithm (example)
\\
- Show expected running time, determined by number of comparisons (quick overview)

Min-cut algorithm:
\\
- Explain the algorithm (example)
\\
- Bound the probability of an incorrect solution (independence, conditional probabilities)

Las Vegas and Monte Carlo algorithms:
\\
- Las Vegas: always correct solution, variation in running time
\\
- Monte Carlo: risk of incorrect solution, bound on probability of incorrect solution, one- and two-sided error.
