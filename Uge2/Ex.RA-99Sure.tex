\subsection*{How many runs of randomized contraction do we need to be 99\% sure that a minimum cut is found?}

In RA section 1.1, the probability of finding a minimum cut is found to be larger than
$$
\frac{2}{n(n-1)}
$$

We wish to find the number, $x$, of runs of the minimum cut algorithm, such that we are 99\% sure that a minimum cut is found.

We can express, that the probability of finding a minimum cut, after $x$ repetitions of the algorithm, is at least 99\%, by
$$
\frac{2}{n(n-1)}^x \geq 99
$$

So we just need to isolate $x$.
$$
\begin{aligned}
\left(\frac{2}{n(n-1)}\right)^x & \geq 99
\\
x\ln\left(\frac{2}{n(n-1)}\right) & \geq \ln(99)
\\
x & \geq \frac{\ln(99)}{\ln\left(\frac{2}{n(n-1)}\right)}
\end{aligned}
$$
