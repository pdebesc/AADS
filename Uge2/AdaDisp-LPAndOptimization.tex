- A linear-programming problem (minimizing, maximizing, linear constraints)
\\
- Applications
\\
- Standard and slack form (rewriting from standard to slack form)
\\
- Example

The simplex algorithm:
- Purpose (solving linear programs)
\\
- Main idea (rewrite to obtain "basic solution")
\\
- Example

Duality:
\\
- Purpose (proving optimality of a solution)
\\
- Example
