\section*{Max Flow Disposition - Peter Christensen}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Define a flow network
	\item Explain the capacity constraint and the flow conservation property
	\item Explain $\abs{f}$ and the problem is to maximize $\abs{f}$
	\item Draw an example of $G$
	\item Explain the residual network and draw and example of $G'$
	\item Prove the Max--flow min--cut theorem
	\item Explain the Ford--Fulkerson algorithm and its running time, with the example of a few iterations.
