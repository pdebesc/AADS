\section{Exercise 26.3-2}
Proof of Theorem 26.10.
\\
\\
The proof is by induction. 

\emph{The base case, the first iteration}
First, the Ford-Fulkerson method initializes the flow to 0. Before the first iteration all values are 


Then, in every iteration, the flow is augmented with the residual capacity, $c_f(p)$, of the augmenting path. Since $c_f(p)$ is set from 
the integer residual capacity of the edges, $|f|$ will always sum up to an integer.
\\
\\
Consider iteration $0$ (no augmenting path):
\\
$|f|$ is initiated to $0$, which is an integer.
\\
Consider iteration $n+1$:
\\
If $|f|$ was an integer after the $n$th iteration, then in the $n+1$th iteration, we will augmenth 
$|f|$ with an integer, which in turn results in an integer.
