\section*{Exercise 26.2-4}
In the example of Figure 26.6, the maximum flow shown has the value 23.
\\
The minimum cut corresponding to this is
$$
(\left\{s,v_1,v_2,v_4\right\}, \left\{v_3,t\right\}),
$$
since the capacity is
$$
c(v_1,v_3) + c(v_4,v_3) + c(v_4,t) = 12+7+4 = 23.
$$
\\
\\
The augmenting path in (c) cancels flow:
\\
4 units on $(v_1, v_2)$ and $(v_2,v_3)$.
