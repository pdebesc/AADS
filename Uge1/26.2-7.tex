\section*{Exercise 26.2-7}
Proof of Lemma 26.2.
\\
\\
We first prove, that $f_p$ is a flow in $G_f$, by proving the capacity constraint and flow conservation property holds in $G_f$.
\\
\\
Capacity constraint:
\\
It is given, that $f_p(u,v)=c_f(p)$, if $(u,v)$ is on the path $p$. We also know that the residual capacity $c_f(p)$ is the minimum capacity of any edge on $p$, which gives us the upper bound on the flow through all edges on the path
\\
$f_p(u,v)\leq c_f(u,v)$
\\
Furthermore, it is also given, that $f_p(u,v)=0$, if $(u,v)$ is not on $p$, which gives the lower bound on the flow
\\
$0 \leq f_p(u,v)$.
\\
\\
Flow conservation property:
\\
As noted earlier, the flow on $p$ will be determined by the residual capacity $c_f(p)$ of $p$, meaning the same flow will be pushed through all edges on $p$. Hence, the flow conservation property holds.
\\
\\
Proof that $|f_p| = c_f(p)>0$:
\\
We know from the definition of the value of a flow, that 
\begin{align}
|f| = \sum_{v\in V}f(s,v) - \sum_{v\in V}f(v,s)
\end{align}

On a path from $s$ to $t$, the number of edges with a positive flow leaving $s$ will be exactly one more than the number of edges with a positive flow that are entering $s$. If this was not the case, then $p$ would not be a path from $s$ to $t$. Hence as all flow on $p$ is the same, the net flow out of $s$ corresponds to what a single edge in the flow can carry in the path $p$ which is $c_f(p)$. So
\begin{align}
|f| = \sum_{v\in V}f(s,v) - \sum_{v\in V}f(v,s) = c_f(p)
\end{align}
To show that $c_f(p)>0$, we note that $c_f(p)$ is the minimum residual capacity on $p$, and since only edges with a positive residual capacity are included in the residual network, the value must be positive.
