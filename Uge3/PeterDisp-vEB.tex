\section*{vEB - Peter Christensen}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Define the goal: To get algorithm with $O(\log\log u)$ runtime for universe of size U
	\item A recursion tree that where the input shrinks $\sqrt{u}$ and constant work in the leafs would give that.
	\item Show an example of a bit vector tree, where the leafs are spint into cluster and the parent are the summart vector.
	\item Define the structure vEb with a $u$, summary, cluster, min, max.
	\item Go through an example of how the structure works, such as Figure~20.6.
	\item go through insert and predecessor algorithm and explain how it works.
