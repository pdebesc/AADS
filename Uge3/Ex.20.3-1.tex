\subsection*{Modify vEB trees to support duplicate keys}

Instead of the tree holding bits, it could instead hold integers. These integers would then act as counters for the number of instances of each key.
\\
Furthermore, to support this change, the element stored in $min$ should appear in the clusters (like $max$), and hold an integer like the rest of the tree.
\\
When inserting and deleting in the tree, the counter should then be updated, by adding to or subtracting from the counter.
