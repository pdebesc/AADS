\subsection*{Argue that if $h$ is strongly universal, then it is also universal.}

To be $c$-universal it must hold that $P(h(x) = h(y))\leq c/m$. To be strongly $c$-universal it must hold that $P(h(x) = h(y))\leq c^2/m^2$. Hence if we can show 
$$\left(\frac{c}{m}\right)^2\leq\frac{c}{m}$$ 
the statement holds. As $\frac{c}{m}$ is the probability of a collision, the value must be in the interval [0,1]. Hence $\left(\frac{c}{m}\right)^2 < \frac{c}{m}$.
