\subsection*{Is the truly independent hash function universial}

Yes - the truly independent hash function universial. 
To prove it we want to show that $P(h(x) = h(y))\leq 1/m$. 

The truely random hash function $h$ is an independent and identical discrete uniformly distributed random variable. 
Hence $h(x)\sim U(0,m-1)$ which means $P(h(x) = j) = 1/m$ for all $j\in[m]$. So for two distinct keys $x,y \in U$
\begin{align*}
P(h(x) = h(y)) &= \sum_{j=0}^{m-1} P([h(x)=j] \cap [h(y)=j])&\\
               &= \sum_{j=0}^{m-1}   P(h(x)=j) P(h(y)=j)    &\text{equality holds as $h$ is independent}\\
							 &= m P^2(h(x)=j)                             &\text{equality holds as $h$ is identical distributed}\\
							 &= m \left(\frac{1}{m}\right)^2              &\text{equality holds as $h$ is uniform distributed}\\
							 &= \frac{1}{m}                               &
\end{align*}
Which shows that the truly independent hash function universial.
