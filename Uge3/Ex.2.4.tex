\subsection*{What is the expected number of elements in $L[h(x)]$ if $x \in S$}

The expected number of elements is
\begin{align*}
E\left[ \abs*{L[(h(x))]} \right] 
       &= \sum_{y\in S} P(h(y) = h(x)) \\
       &= 1 + \sum_{y\in S\backslash\{x\}} P(h(y) = h(x)) \\
       &\leq 1 + \frac{n-1}{m} < 2
\end{align*}
The first equality is the same as in the notes. The next equality we used the assumption that $x\in S$ which will give a give a collision with probability 1. Hence that element is extracted. The last equality comes from the fact that $h$ is universal hence each collision probability is less than $1/m$ and there are $n-1$ elements in the sum.

\emph{What is the bound if $h$ is 2 universal?}
\\
The calculations would be the same, the only thing that will change is where the inequality sign is. For 2 universal the probability is $P(h(x)=h(y))\leq \frac{2}{m}$. There are $n-1$ of those probabilities in the sum, hence the result would be
$$
E\left[ \abs*{L[(h(x))]} \right]  \leq 1 + \frac{2(n-1)}{m}
$$
