\section*{Exercise 20.3-6}
\subsection*{The smallest number of operations $n$ for which the amortized time of each operation in a vEB tree is $O(\lg\lg u)$}

The amortized time of each operation are calculated, by taking the sum of the time for each operation, and dividing this by the number of all operations.
\\
Now, creating the entire universe takes $\Theta (u)$ time, which must account for all operations, so we can express the amortized time of each operation by
$$
\lg\lg u = \frac{u}{n}
$$
giving us $n = \frac{u}{\lg\lg u}$. Hence, we need at least $\frac{u}{\lg\lg u}$ operations.
