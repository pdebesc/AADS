\subsection*{Running times for the modified operations}

The recursive procedures that implement the vEB tree operations have running times characterized by the recurrence
$$
T(u) \leq T(u^{1/k}) + T(u^{1-1/k}) + O(1),
$$
where the first part is due to the number of clusters, and the second part is due to the size of the clusters, which are enumerated.
\\
By letting $m=\lg u$, such that $u=2^m$, then
$$
T(2^m) \leq T(2^{m/k}) + T(u^{m-m/k}) + O(1)
$$
We then rename $S(m)=T(2^m)$, which results in
$$
S(m) \leq S(m/k) + S(m-m/k) + O(1) = S(m/k) + S\left(\frac{m(k-1)}{k}\right) + O(1)
$$
For $k>2$, the second part will dominate, so in terms of running time, we can "ignore" the first term. In this case, case 2 of the master theorem applies, and $S(m)$ has the solution $S(m)=O(\lg m)$.
By changing back, we can conclude, that
$$
T(u) = T(2^m) = S(m) = O(\lg m) = O(\lg\lg u)
$$
