\subsection*{what is the upper bound}

As $h$ is strongly $c$-universal the keys hash independently, hence

\begin{align*}
P(h(x)=q \land h(y)=r) &= P(h(x)=q \cap h(y)=r) = P(h(x)=q) P(h(y)=r) \\
                       &\leq \frac{c}{m} \frac{c}{m} = \left(\frac{c}{m}\right)^2
\end{align*}

So the upper bound is $c^2/m^2$
