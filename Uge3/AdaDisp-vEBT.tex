\section*{van Emde Boas Trees summary - Ada Nzulumike}

Introduction:
\\
- Storing a dynamic set in an array (running time $u$ for several operations)

Superimposing tree structures:
\\
- A binary tree structure (illustration, running time down to $\lg u$)
\\
- A binary tree of constant height (illustration, running time down to $\sqrt{u}$)

van Emde Boas Trees:
\\
- A recursive structure
\\
- High, low, index, summaries, clusters, min and max
