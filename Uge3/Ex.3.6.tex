\subsection*{Give upper bound for probability}

We are given $\abs{A}=10^8, p=1/100, \mu=10^6$. 

First note that $\sqrt{\mu} = 1,000$, we want to use Lemma~3.2 to bound $\abs*{X-\mu}\geq 10,000$. Hence we find that $q = 10$ as $q\mu= 10,000$. So
$$
P(\abs*{X-10^6}\geq 10^4)\leq \frac{1}{10^2} = \frac{1}{100}
$$
So the upper bound is 1\%.
