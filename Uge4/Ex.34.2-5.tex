\subsection*{Show that any language in NP can be decided by an algorithm running in time $2^{O(n^k)}$ for some constant $k$}

First note, that if we can verify a language, then we can also decide it.
\\
Now, we know that we can verify any language L $\in$ NP in polynomial time (top of page 1064, CLRS), with a two-input algorithm. As input, the algorithm takes $x\in L$ and a certificate $y$. Since the length of any certificate is bounded by $O(|x|^c)$, the input $x$ can at most be $O(|x|^c)$ long.
\\
If we run the algorithm on every possible input $x\in {0,1}^*$, with that maxlength, it will take time $2^{O(n^k)}$.
