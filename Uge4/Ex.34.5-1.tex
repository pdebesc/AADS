\subsection*{Subgraph--isomorphism problem (SI)}


To show that SI is NP complete we want to show that 1) SI is in NP, and 2) CLIQUE $\leq_P$ SI.

To show that SI is NP:
\\
Given the function $f$ which map vertex names in $G_1$ to vertex names in $G_2$, the isomorphism problem can be verified in linear time. Given vertices $V_1$ and edges $E_1$ in $G_1$ we can also in linear time determine if $G_1$ is a sub--graph of $G_2$. Combining the two we can in linear time determine if $G_1$ is subgraph--isomorphic to $G_2$. Hence SI is NP.

To see that CLIQUE $\leq_P$ SI:
\\
Note that we must map all CLIQUE problem to some $G_1$. Let $G_1$ be the complete graph with $k$ vertices, then solving SI would also solve CLIQUE, and as CLIQUE is NP complete, so is SI.
