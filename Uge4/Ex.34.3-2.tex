\subsection*{Show that the $\leq_P$ relation is a transitive relation on languages}

We want to show, that if $L_1\leq_P L_2$ and $L_2\leq_P L_3$, then $L_1\leq_P L_3$.
\\
Since $L_1\leq_P L_2$ and $L_2\leq_P L_3$, then there exists polynomial-time computable reduction functions $f_A$ and $f_B$, where $f_A$ reduces $L_1$ to $L_2$, and $f_B$ reduces $L_2$ to $L_3$.
\\
A polynomial-time computable reduction function $f_C$ can simply use first $f_A$ and then $f_B$, to reduce $L_1$ to $L_3$, meaning we must have $L_1\leq_P L_3$.
