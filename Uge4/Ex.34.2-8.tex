\subsection*{Show that TAUTOLOGY $\in$ co-NP}

The question is analog to showing that $\overline{\text{TAUTOLOGY}}\in$ NP, where $\overline{\text{TAUTOLOGY}}$ is the complement of TAUTOLOGY.
\\
$\overline{\text{TAUTOLOGY}}$ must be the language of boolean formulas, where changing the assignment of at least one variable will cause the formula $\phi$ to evaluate to 0.

If we can verify a certificate in polynomial time, then $\overline{\text{TAUTOLOGY}}\in$ NP. A certificate would be an assignment of variables, and we can check in polynomial time, that $\overline{\text{TAUTOLOGY}}$ evaluates to 0.

Since $\overline{\text{TAUTOLOGY}}$ has fewer connectives than SAT, and no connectives that SAT does not, then $\overline{\text{TAUTOLOGY}}$ is a proper subset of SAT, i.e. $\overline{\text{TAUTOLOGY}} \subset \text{SAT}$. As SAT $\in$ NP, this then implies that $\overline{\text{TAUTOLOGY}} \in$ NP, which then means that TAUTOLOGY $\in$ co-NP.
