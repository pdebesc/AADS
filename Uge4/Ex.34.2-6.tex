\subsection*{Show that HAM-PATH $\in$ NP}

If we can verify a certificate in polynomial time, then HAM-PATH $\in$ NP.

A certificate could be a path from $u$ to $v$ in $G$:
\\
- Check that all edges on the path is in $E$, where $G=(V,E)$.
\\
- Check that that the vertices on the path covers all vertices in $V$.
\\
This can be done in polynomial time.
