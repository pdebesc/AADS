\subsection*{Hamiltonian path NP complete}

To show that HAM--PATH is NP complete we show
\begin{enumerate}[]
	\item HAM--PATH is NP
	\item HAM--CYCLE $\leq_P$ HAM--PATH
\end{enumerate}
That HAM--PATH is NP, is shown in EX.34.2-6

To see that HAM--CYCLE $\leq_P$ HAM--PATH,

Given a graph $G$ where there is an instance of HAM--CYCLE, pick a node $u$ and create a new graph $G'$ where $u$ is replaced with two new nodes $u'$ and $u''$. All the edges that goes in to $u$ are also going into $u''$ and all of the outgoing edges from $u$ are also outgoing edges from $u'$. No edges are going from $u'$ to $u''$. 

$G$ has HAM--CYCLE $\Leftrightarrow$ $G'$ has HAM--PATH

Before we prove it, note that a HAM--PATH must start in $u'$ and end in $u''$

We show $\Rightarrow$

Assume $G$ has HAM-CYCLE, then the same nodes creates a HAM--CYCLE in $G'$ if we split $u$ into $u'$ and $u''$.

We show $\Leftarrow$

Assume $G'$ has HAM-PATH, then combining $u'$ and $u''$ into $u$ will create a HAM-CYCLE in $G$.


This show item 2. Hence we have shown that HAM-PATH is NP complete.
